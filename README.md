This project is a practice of my HTML and CSS skills. 
I will deconstruct the google homepage and try to recreate it in a new HTML file. 
By the end I should have learned how to create a basic webpage and be able to move tags around the screen, identify different colour schemes used through the dev tools, and understand basic CSS classes and tags.
